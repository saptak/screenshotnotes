# Screenshot Vault - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: July 10, 2024
**Last Updated**: July 10, 2024

## Introduction

Screenshot Vault ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Screenshot Vault mobile application (the "App").

## Our Privacy-First Approach

Screenshot Vault is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your personal data should remain personal, which is why we've built an app that processes everything locally on your device.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Screenshot Vault does not collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

- **Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personal identifiers
- **Screenshot Content**: Your screenshots never leave your device
- **Text Data**: OCR-extracted text is processed and stored only on your device
- **Search Queries**: Your search history remains local to your device
- **Usage Analytics**: We do not track how you use the app
- **Location Data**: We do not access or store location information
- **Device Information**: We do not collect device identifiers or technical specifications
- **Account Information**: No accounts are created or maintained

## How the App Works

Screenshot Vault operates entirely on your device:

### Local Processing
- **OCR Text Extraction**: All text recognition happens on your device using Apple's Vision framework
- **AI Analysis**: Entity recognition and semantic analysis occur locally
- **Mind Map Generation**: Relationship mapping is computed on your device
- **Search Indexing**: Search databases are created and stored locally

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage Only**: All app data is stored in your device's local storage
- **No Cloud Services**: We do not use any cloud storage or processing services
- **No External Servers**: No data is transmitted to external servers

## Device Permissions

The app requests the following permissions to function:

### Photos Access
- **Purpose**: To access and organize your screenshots
- **Scope**: Read-only access to your photo library
- **Usage**: Screenshots are processed locally and never transmitted elsewhere

### Microphone Access (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Voice search functionality
- **Scope**: Audio input for voice commands only
- **Usage**: Voice input is processed locally using Apple's Speech framework
- **Note**: This permission is optional and only requested when using voice search

### Background Processing
- **Purpose**: To complete AI processing tasks
- **Scope**: Limited background processing for OCR and analysis
- **Usage**: Ensures smooth user experience without blocking the interface

## Data Security

### On-Device Security
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted using iOS standard encryption
- **Sandboxed Storage**: App data is stored in a secure, sandboxed environment
- **No Network Transmission**: No data leaves your device through network connections

### Privacy by Design
- **No Tracking**: We do not track user behavior or app usage
- **No Analytics**: We do not collect analytics data
- **No Advertisements**: We do not display ads or work with advertising networks
- **No Third-Party Services**: We do not integrate with third-party analytics or data services

## Children's Privacy

Screenshot Vault does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## Changes to Screenshots

When you use Screenshot Vault:

- **Original Photos Remain Unchanged**: Your original screenshots in the Photos app are never modified
- **Processing Results**: OCR text, entity recognition, and mind map data are stored separately in the app
- **Deletion**: If you delete the app, all processed data is permanently removed from your device

## Data Retention

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- **User Control**: You have complete control over your data
- **App Deletion**: Removing the app permanently deletes all associated data
- **No Remote Storage**: We have no remote copies of your data to retain or delete

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, traditional data protection rights (such as access, rectification, or deletion requests) do not apply in the conventional sense. However, you have complete control over your data:

- **Full Access**: You can access all your data within the app
- **Complete Control**: You can delete any processed data by removing the app
- **No External Copies**: There are no external copies of your data to be concerned about

## International Users

Screenshot Vault's privacy-first approach means that regardless of your location, your data remains on your device. We do not transfer data internationally because we do not collect or transmit data.

## Technical Implementation

### Apple Frameworks Used
- **Vision Framework**: For on-device OCR and image analysis
- **Natural Language Framework**: For on-device text processing
- **Core ML**: For on-device machine learning processing
- **Speech Framework**: For on-device voice recognition (when permission granted)

### No Third-Party SDKs
- We do not use third-party analytics SDKs
- We do not use third-party advertising SDKs
- We do not use third-party data collection services

## Compliance

Screenshot Vault is designed to comply with:

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: By not collecting personal data
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: By not collecting personal information
- **COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)**: By not collecting any data from users
- **Apple App Store Guidelines**: Following Apple's privacy requirements

## Summary

Screenshot Vault is built on the principle that your personal data should remain personal. By processing everything locally on your device and not collecting any personal information, we ensure that your privacy is protected by design, not just by policy.

Your screenshots, the text extracted from them, and the insights generated are yours alone. They remain on your device, under your control, and are never transmitted to us or anyone else.
