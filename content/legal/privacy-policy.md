## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Screenshot Vault is built with privacy as our foundational principle. We believe your personal data should remain personal, private, and under your complete control.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Screenshot Vault is designed to operate entirely on your device. We do **not** collect, store, access, or transmit:

- Your screenshots or images
- Text extracted from your screenshots (OCR data)
- Search queries or search history
- AI analysis results or semantic tags
- Photos library contents or metadata
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Device identifiers or personal information
- Location data or timestamps
- Any personal or sensitive information

## How Screenshot Vault Works

### Local Processing Only
- **All AI processing happens locally on your device** using Apple's built-in frameworks
- **No internet connection required** for core functionality
- **No cloud servers** involved in processing your content
- **No third-party AI services** used

### Photo Library Access
Screenshot Vault requests access to your photo library only when you:
- Choose to import screenshots manually
- Use the pull-to-refresh bulk import feature

**What we access:**
- Only screenshots you explicitly choose to import
- Basic image metadata (creation date, size) for organization

**What we do with this data:**
- Store imported screenshots locally in the app's private database
- Process them locally for OCR text extraction and AI analysis
- Never transmit or share this data with anyone

### Data Storage
- All your screenshots and extracted data are stored locally on your device
- Data is protected by iOS's built-in encryption and security features
- Only you can access your data through the Screenshot Vault app
- Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all associated data

## Permissions We Request

### Photo Library Access (Optional)
- **Purpose**: To import screenshots you want to organize and search
- **Scope**: Read-only access to photos you explicitly select
- **Frequency**: Only when you initiate import actions
- **Alternative**: You can deny this permission and still use the app with manually added content

## Third-Party Services

Screenshot Vault does **not** use any third-party services, analytics, advertising networks, or cloud processing services.

## Data Security

- **Device Encryption**: Your data benefits from iOS's robust device encryption
- **App Sandbox**: Screenshot Vault operates within Apple's strict app sandbox environment
- **No Network Transmission**: Since we don't transmit data, there's no risk of interception
- **Regular Security Updates**: We maintain the app with the latest iOS security standards

## Children's Privacy

Screenshot Vault is rated 4+ and does not collect any personal information from users of any age. The app operates entirely locally and requires no account creation or personal data input.

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: View all your imported screenshots within the app
- **Modify**: Edit, organize, or delete screenshots at any time
- **Export**: Export your screenshots and data if needed
- **Delete**: Permanently remove all data by uninstalling the app

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will:
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Notify users through an app update with clear changelog information
- Maintain our core commitment to local-only, privacy-first operation

## No Data Breaches Possible
