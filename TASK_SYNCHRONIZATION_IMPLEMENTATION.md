    modelContext: modelContext!,
    backgroundProcessors: BackgroundProcessors(...)
)
```

### **Service Integration:**
```swift
// Background processing with task coordination
await taskManager.execute(
    category: .semantic,
    priority: .normal,
    description: "Process screenshots needing semantic analysis"
) {
    // Coordinated processing logic
}
```
