## 1. Vision & Introduction

Screenshot Notes is a beautiful and intuitive iOS application designed to revolutionize how users manage and interact with their screenshots. In a world where screenshots are a primary method of information capture, this app provides a seamless, intelligent, and fluid experience for automatically organizing, searching, and contextualizing that information. By leveraging the latest in on-device AI, Screenshot Notes transforms a cluttered photo library into an interconnected, searchable knowledge base.

## 2. Target Audience

*   **Power Users & Professionals:** Designers, developers, researchers, and students who rely on screenshots for work, inspiration, and note-taking.
*   **Productivity Enthusiasts:** Individuals who want to optimize their personal information management and reduce digital clutter.
*   **General iOS Users:** Anyone who frequently uses screenshots to save information and struggles to find it later.

## 3. Core Principles & Design Language

The user experience is paramount and will be guided by the following principles:

*   **Intuitive:** The app will be immediately understandable. The user journey, from import to search, will feel natural and require minimal learning.
*   **Fluid & Responsive:** Every interaction, animation, and transition will be smooth, immediate, and delightful, targeting 120fps on ProMotion displays. Design Guidelines: https://developer.apple.com/design/Human-Interface-Guidelines/materials
*   **Reliable:** The app must be exceptionally stable, with robust background processing and data integrity.
*   **Beautiful:** The UI will be clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing, employing the "Glass UX" language. This involves the use of translucency, layered materials, and depth to create a lightweight and focused environment.

### Design System Specifications

    *   Primary: SF Pro Display for headings
    *   Body: SF Pro Text for content
    *   Monospace: SF Mono for OCR text display
*   **Spacing:** 8pt grid system (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
*   **Corner Radius:** 12pt for cards, 8pt for buttons, 20pt for sheets
*   **Shadows:** Subtle depth with 2-4pt blur radius
*   **Animations:**
    *   Spring animations (dampingFraction: 0.8, response: 0.6)
    *   Gesture-driven interactions with rubber-band effects
    *   Fade and scale transitions for modal presentations

## 4. Features

### 4.1. Automated Screenshot Management
*   **Automatic Import:** The app will monitor the device for new screenshots and automatically import them into its library in the background.
*   **Optional Deletion:** A user-configurable setting will allow for the automatic deletion of the original screenshot from the Apple Photos app to prevent duplicates and reduce clutter.

### 4.2. On-Device Intelligence & Content Extraction
*   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** All text and objects within every screenshot will be extracted, indexed, and made searchable. Use Apple Generative AI: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/generative-ai
*   **Object & Scene Recognition:** The app will identify and tag key objects, logos, UI elements (e.g., buttons, forms), and scenes (e.g., maps, charts, conversations).
*   **Contextual Linking (Mind Map):** The app will intelligently analyze the content of screenshots to automatically create links between them, forming a visual mind map or knowledge graph based on shared text, topics, or visual context.
    *   **Performance-Optimized Layout:** Mind map layout calculation is cached and only recalculated when underlying data changes (new screenshots, deleted screenshots, updated AI analysis, or user edits)
    *   **Incremental Layout Updates:** When data changes occur, layout recalculation is localized to affected nodes and their immediate connections to avoid full map regeneration
    *   **Data Consistency Management:** Robust handling of edge cases including screenshot deletion, user annotation changes, AI re-analysis updates, and manual relationship modifications

### 4.3. Search & Discovery
*   **Universal Search:** A powerful, fast search engine to find screenshots based on:
    *   Any text content within the screenshot.
    *   Automatically or manually assigned tags.
    *   Recognized objects or scenes.
    *   Metadata (e.g., date, time, source application if identifiable).
*   **Conversational AI Search:** Natural language search powered by Apple Intelligence, allowing users to:
    *   Type or speak queries like "find screenshots with blue dress", "show me receipts from Marriott", "find the link to website selling lens"
    *   Use contextual phrases like "find that restaurant menu from last week" or "show me screenshots about travel plans"
    *   Search by visual descriptions: "screenshots with QR codes", "images with charts or graphs", "pictures of text messages"
    *   Combine multiple criteria: "find recent screenshots with phone numbers from shopping apps"
*   **Siri Integration:** Hands-free search through Apple's virtual assistant with App Intents:
    *   "Hey Siri, search Screenshot Vault for blue dress"
    *   "Hey Siri, find receipts from Marriott in Screenshot Vault"
    *   "Hey Siri, show me screenshots with website links"
    *   "Hey Siri, find screenshots from last Tuesday with phone numbers"
    *   Results displayed in Siri interface with option to open full app for detailed viewing
*   **Smart Query Interpretation:** AI-powered query understanding that:
    *   Extracts semantic meaning from natural language queries
    *   Maps conversational terms to visual and textual content
    *   Handles synonyms, context, and implicit relationships
