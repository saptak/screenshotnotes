## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implementation

### Material Design System Components

1. **Depth Token System**
   ```swift
   enum DepthToken: Int {
       case background = 0      // Base layer - no elevation
       case surface = 1         // Cards, panels - 1dp elevation
       case overlay = 2         // Floating elements - 2dp elevation
       case modal = 3           // Modals, sheets - 4dp elevation
       case tooltip = 4         // Tooltips, popovers - 8dp elevation
       case dropdown = 5        // Dropdowns, menus - 12dp elevation
       case navigation = 6      // Navigation bars - 16dp elevation
       case dialog = 7          // Dialogs, alerts - 24dp elevation
   }
   ```

2. **Material Configuration**
   - Strategic mapping of depth tokens to Apple's Material types
   - Automatic fallback for accessibility settings
   - Performance-optimized rendering

3. **Shadow System**
   - Consistent shadow configuration per depth token
   - Elevation-based shadow radius and offset
   - Optimized for visual hierarchy

### View Extensions

1. **Convenience Methods**
   ```swift
   .materialBackground(depth: .surface, cornerRadius: 12)
   .surfaceMaterial(cornerRadius: 12, stroke: .subtle)
   .overlayMaterial(cornerRadius: 12, stroke: .subtle)
   .modalMaterial(cornerRadius: 16)
   ```

2. **Stroke Configuration**
   - Predefined stroke styles (subtle, emphasis, strong)
   - Accessibility-compliant color mapping
   - Consistent line weight standards

## üé® Visual Enhancements

### Before vs After Material Usage

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Search Field | `.ultraThinMaterial` + manual stroke | `.overlayMaterial()` with integrated stroke |
| Search Container | `.regularMaterial` | `.materialBackground(depth: .navigation)` |
| Screenshot Cards | Manual shadow + stroke | `.surfaceMaterial()` with integrated depth |
| Detail Overlays | `Color.black.opacity(0.3)` | `.overlayMaterial()` with system adaptation |
| Import Overlay | `.regularMaterial` | `.modalMaterial()` with proper elevation |
